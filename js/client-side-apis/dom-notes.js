// Document.querySelector() is the recommended modern approach,
// it is convenient because it allows you to select elements using CSS
// selectors
// The above querySelector() call will match the first a element
// that appears in the document. 
// If you wanted to match and do things to multiple elements, you could use
// Document.querySelectorAll() which matches every element in the document
// that matches that selector and stores references to them in an array-like
// object called NodeList

// There are older methods available such as getElementById and byTagName
